# DCC-Assignment-4-Flask

### Web Development with FLASK, part of the DCC course.

- The `scripts` folder has the script (`pdf_extractor.py`) to convert pdf files (containing tabular data) into csv files using the `FITZ` module.
- Loading the csv files into the table was done in 2 ways, using SQL Query, and by using the Import Data Wizard
